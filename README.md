# PF2e Custom Action Sections
A module for the pf2e Foundry VTT system that lets you assign custom sections to items that are displayed in the Encounters area of the Actions tab.

- This only works on `character` (PC) type actors right now
- There is no drag-drop support
- There is no way to mass move items between sections

# Example Use
A. Custom sections are indicated with a blue tag.
B. Leaving the custom section label field blank will display the item in its default section (in this case, Reactions).
C. Entering text into the label field will put the item into a section with the matching name. If no section exists, it is created.
