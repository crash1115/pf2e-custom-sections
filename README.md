# PF2e Custom Action Sections
A module for the pf2e Foundry VTT system that lets you assign custom sections to items that are displayed in the Encounters area of the Actions tab.

## Tips
- Avoid creating sections with the same names as the default ones (Attacks, Actions, Reactions, Free Actions etc). This won't put the item into the default section, it'll create a new section of the same name and tag both your new one and the default one as a custom section.

## Notes
- This only works on `character` (PC) type actors right now
- There is no drag-drop support
- There is no way to mass move items between sections
- There is no way to sort or reorder custom sections

# Example Use
- [A] Custom sections are indicated with a blue tag.
- [B] Leaving the custom section label field blank will display the item in its default section (in this case, Reactions).
- [C] Entering text into the label field will put the item into a section with the matching name. If no section exists, it is created.
